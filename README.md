# Desgn Landing Page (Figma-to-Code)
During this video series, we’re going to do a full design-to-code landing page.

We’ll start by hand-designing everything in Figma and then code out the page using a new static site generator called Astro. To style the site, we’ll write modern CSS and tack on a few superpowers using Open Props, a brand new framework made entirely from css variables. And for a bit of extra fun, we’ll hook our styling up with Post CSS and Open Props’ just-in-time engine to keep our compiled stylesheet lightweight and speedy, only including props we use and our manually-typed CSS.
